         <p>Misty Copeland's journey from improverish childhood to principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre was long and filled with difficulty. Misty's talent was first noticed by Dana (middle school) drill team coach. Misty had a natural grace about her. Misty did not study ballet or gymnastics at a young age. She first took ballet lessons at the Boys and Girls Club at the age of 13. This age was considered too old to even think of a career as a professional ballerina. It did not stop Misty from dreaming of becaming a prima ballerina. At the age of 15, Misty was briefly emancipated from her mother. She went to live with her dance teacher (Cynthia Bradley) to continue her dance. Misty spent the next three years living with the Bradleys.
          <p>Within four years of dedication and hard work, Misty was accepted into one of the top ballet companies. While it was quite an accomplishment to be accepted in presitigious dance company, there were still difficulties to deal with. There were very few African-American ballet dancers at the American Ballet Theatre. Sensing Misty's isolation and self-doubt were affecting her, Susan Fales-Hill (vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors) began to mentor Misty.  Ms. Copeland was introduced to several African-American women trailblazers, who encouraged her and help her gain the confidence she needed.  Misty Copeland from her humble beginnings to Principal ballerina, was always outstanding in dance. Misty continues to be this way in all other adventures, she pursues.</p>
